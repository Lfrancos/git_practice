Hello Git and Github
I'm adding this, to see if I understoood how this works.

It seems to have worked. Now I need to keep practicing and pushing my self to make all this commands second nature to me.
Hopefully at the end of this year I will be creating interesting websites, and by the end of next I have a solid understanding of fullstack to start creating interesting platforms.
